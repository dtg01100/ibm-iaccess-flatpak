# TASK001 - Flatpak Build, Install, and Test

**Status:** In Progress  
**Added:** 2025-08-07  
**Updated:** 2025-08-07

## Original Request
Build, install, and test the IBM i Access Flatpak bundle. Iterate until the build works, then install and attempt to launch. Document all steps and troubleshooting.

## Thought Process
- The build process has encountered repeated issues with the OpenJDK module, specifically with archive extraction and file naming.
- The goal is to achieve a reproducible, working Flatpak bundle using the latest Adoptium OpenJDK 17 tarball, then install and verify launch.
- All steps, errors, and fixes will be tracked for future reference and reproducibility.

## Implementation Plan
- [ ] Clean previous build artifacts
- [ ] Build Flatpak bundle with correct OpenJDK source
- [ ] Install the generated Flatpak bundle
- [ ] Attempt to launch the application
- [ ] Troubleshoot and iterate until successful
- [ ] Update documentation and Memory Bank
