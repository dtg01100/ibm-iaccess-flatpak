# System Patterns

## Architecture
- Modular packaging for platform-specific components
- Centralized documentation repository
- Automated build and release pipeline

## Key Technical Decisions
- Use Docker for containerization
- Multi-stage builds for efficiency and security
- Semantic versioning for releases

## Design Patterns
- Separation of concerns: packaging, documentation, automation
- Immutability and reproducibility in builds

## Component Relationships
- Packaging scripts interact with platform folders
- Documentation is referenced by onboarding scripts
